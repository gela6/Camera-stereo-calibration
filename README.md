# Development of a multiple depth-camera system for generating datasets to train neural networks
This is the project for my master's thesis on Faculty of mechanical engineering and naval architecture in Zagreb. 
I have used libraries: OpenCV, PCL, Open3D, Eigen, liberalsense(for RealSense cameras) etc. in C++. And also required Python libraries for preparing data and machine learning: NumPy, pandas etc.

# Project workflow

Step 1. Design and make a laboratory setup with three Intel RealSense D435 cameras.
